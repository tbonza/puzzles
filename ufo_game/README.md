# UFO Game

This is a minimal UFO game written in Racket. If you already are familiar
with Racket, you can open DrRacket and start the game with

```
main(WORLD-INITIALIZE)
```
If you're new to Racket, I think a good resource is [An Introduction to Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/) which includes steps to install DrRacket. Gameplay involves
moving the tank left or right with arrow keys. Space bar will shoot the missile.
You win by downing the UFO and lose if the UFO manages to land.

## Development

There are several possible ways you could extend/improve this game. I think the
most relevant documentation is available with [2.4 Worlds and the Universe](https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html). The game was started based on exercises 
from [HTDP2](https://htdp.org/).
